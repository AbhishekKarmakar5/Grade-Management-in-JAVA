# Grade-Management-in-JAVA
This is an very efficient way of managing grades of all the students. Every student has their own login ID as well as the Professors has their own. Students can only see their marks and graph, but cannot change anything. Where as in this case, the professors can only see and change the marks of the students only of their own subject. They cannot access anything of others. The last part is about the Assistant Registrar, she can change the marks of all the students, can calculate the grades of all the students directly through a button as well can keep a track of the failed students in the list. The Options being provided are INSERT, DELETE, CLEAR and UPDATE database in SQLYOG.
